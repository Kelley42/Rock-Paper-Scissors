# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a rock paper scissors game I made for a Udemy course.

Instead of typing numbers for the choices, I decided to have users type the word out. To me this is just easier than having users remember what number goes with which word.

## How to Play

Pick rock, paper, or scissors to beat the computer. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
